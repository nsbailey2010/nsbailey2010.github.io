            <h1> About Me</h1>
            <hr />
            <p>I became interested in web design while working on my Master’s of Information Science
             at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. Throughout my curriculum there, I studied
             many aspects of web design. I learned not only how to code for the web using HTML and
             CSS, but also how to implement best practices such as mobile first and responsive design.
             Much of my coursework also focused on the study of Human-Computer Interaction which
             involved performing usability studies for existing sites and developing redesigns using
             HCI principles and Information Architecture. I also gained considerable experience
             building sites using the three leading Content Management Systems: WordPress, Joomla,
             and Drupal.</p>

            <p>Along with undergraduate work in Computer Science and Business Administration, my academic
             career has provided me with a firm foundation in modern technology and business. Since
             completing my MIS in May of 2016, I have been focused on the study of programming languages
             and full stack web development.</p>

            <h1> About This Site</h1>
            <hr />
            <p>I created this site as a place to practice new techniques as well as showcase projects
             that I have worked on. This of course means that the site will likely always be in a
             constant state of change, however, I make every effort to ensure that the live version
             of the site is always working. To accomplish that, I do the site development and testing
             in a local environment and use a mirrored Git repository for version control. Changes
             are then pushed to the live site once they are ready to be published.</p>

            <p>The site uses the Express framework running in a Node.js environment hosted on Redhat’s
             OpenShift and is linked to a mySQL database. A Node.js package called mysql is used to
             enable the server to communicate with the database, and a package named formidable is
             used for form aggregation. Site functionality is accomplished using JavaScript along
             with the JQuery and JQuery UI libraries. The icon font libraries FontAwesome and
             Devicons are also used where applicable.</p>
